Pre Alpha Version Althogh mostly Stable Havent Tested much.

# Install
1. Extract Files
2. Copy both Folders to Root AKI Folder
3. Edit travel.json in PTT Config Folder with current Offraid Positions accoring to your PTT Config. (I have not sanitized my version to the master PTT yet)

## Using

When fist staring game and selecting a time you lock that time in until restarting the client. (I can make this a saved file that would persist though reboots ... ðŸ¤”)
Time will no longer move out of raid and travel time will be added between raids not including your first raid on client start.


### Notes
`Factory and Labs have no Weather Module so you cannot change in-game time (I could hunt down the network function and patch it but I'm lazy ðŸ˜ª)`

`I could also have the Offraid positions pull from the PTT config but this keeps PTT Modular.`

### Thanks ZTrap for your wonderful PTT Mod

### Big Thanks to SamSWAT / TimeWeatherChanger
