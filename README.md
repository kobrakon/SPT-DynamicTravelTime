Alpha Version Althogh mostly Stable Havent Tested much.

# Install
1. Extract Files
2. Copy both Folders to Root AKI Folder
3. Edit traveltime.json in r1ft-PTTDynamicTimeCycle with current Offraid Positions accoring to your PTT Config. (I have not sanitized my version to the master PTT yet)

## Using
Locks raid time to a 24 Hour Cycle till leaving hideout or dying. Labs and Factory have no Weather Module so time cannot be changed on these maps. (Factory is locked to day or night based on time). Travel Times are in Minutes and can be configured in traveltime.json. (Travel time takes place when loading into raid) The 24 hour cycle will also persist though server and client reboots.

### Thanks Trap for your wonderful PTT Mod

### Big Thanks to SamSWAT / TimeWeatherChanger
