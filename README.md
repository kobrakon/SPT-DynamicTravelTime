1.0 Version Should be Stable Havent Tested much.

# Install
1. Extract Files
2. Copy both Folders to Root AKI Folder
3. Edit user/mods/r1ft-DynamicTimeCycle/cfg/config.json with travel times taking place when entering map.

## NOTES
- If Path to Tarkov is installed the config uses the second set on locations in the config relating to PTT's offraid position.
- If you do not have PTT installed the first raid on the account will lock the time in place.

## Using
Locks raid time to a 24 Hour Cycle till leaving hideout or dying. Labs and Factory have no Weather Module so time cannot be changed on these maps. (Factory is locked to day or night based on time). Travel Times are in Minutes and can be configured in traveltime.json. (Travel time takes place when loading into raid) The 24 hour cycle will also persist though server and client reboots.

### Thanks Trap for your wonderful PTT Mod
